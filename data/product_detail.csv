White marble buildings surround the murky waters. Long bodies exit the deep blue, like wide decapitation wires wrapping around and between the trees. They rush around, feeding on the small animals and fish in the Garden of Residues.

I stand atop the tallest bridge. Their eyes meet mine, rich with starvation while they cannibalize each other. A tomato soup paste brews into an increasingly viscous surface.

So dense with gore, I swear I could reach out and stand on it.

So close that I stumble and fall into it.

*Splash.*

The youngest of her friends, and also the only girl amongst them. Jackson used to bully her, but Thomas invited her to play tag with them on multiple occasions. Eventually, she became part of the group.

Having protected her friends from the choice of conscription or execution by the Grevan military, she has a reputation of knowing how to dish out some serious firepower.

She often feels the need to scream, breathlessly shouting into the shivering Aphantasian airs.

Maybe Ten Thousand Guns saw something in her. Maybe that’s why it hasn’t killed her yet.

Iscara’s lying if she says she can control it. It owns her.",,

The bushes rattle from something hiding within them. Its long body is perfectly visible beyond the tiny segments of foliage. One could barely call it successful.

It growls, emitting a strong odor of phosphorus.

The bush lights aflame, spooking it. I nearly expect it to attack, but it shies away to another bush, which also bursts into flames.

The Alpha Draculi bashes its head against the grass, taking out its frustration.",,

It glows like a blow torch expanding in every direction. The crowd disperses away from the miniature star, unable to bear the immense heat of its presence.

The Rotakin seem accustomed to this forced loneliness. They float deliberately above the humans and humanoids beneath them.

The hunched over beggar approaches me, seemingly rolling. It looks up, revealing the machine below its baggy, blanket-like clothing.

Its speaker blares as it reaches for me. ""Do you have spare change?""

*Vroom. Vroom.*

""I have refurbished parts for you to try!"" it exclaims excitedly.

A set of cold tools pin me to the city floor, pressing me against the asphalt. They cut through my sternum. *Crunch.* My heart is detached with a few smooth incisions, and the auto-medic steals it away to a compartment within itself. A light glows to show me the library of human organs inside.

""Oh! I'm sorry! I'm out of refurbished parts! Maybe next time!""

I fade away on the ground as it casually rolls away, hunting the homeless.",,

The arena is in complete silence. She can almost hear the sound of sands moved by the tense wind. She sees a duelist standing in the middle of the arena. He has a mecha-blade and is surrounded by five intimidating opponents.

It's hard for her to read the duelist's expressions. He wears a mask covering half of his face. Yet, she can feel him growing impatient.

When the arena bell rings, two opponents are sliced down viciously in a matter of seconds. He moves swiftly from one to the next, almost like he is dancing with death itself.

There's no ounce of hesitation in his moves. Everything seems planned in his head before the fight even began. He's perfectly choreographed.

After only five seconds, the sand is painted in sticky crimson from the slain corpses.

His last opponent, crawling on the ground with spilled guts and a lost eye, begs for mercy, but the duelist doesn't have any to offer.

It’s her first time in the arena. Being a high-class noble, she's never seen such brutality before. Deep down, she really enjoys it. She has quickly developed an affection for this duelist, but she isn’t the only one. The crowd is already roaring ""Laurence!""",,

Huge beasts emerge from their deep home in the ocean to hunt from the sea stacks scattered about. Beyond them lies a beautiful Victorian castle, impossible to see through the thick grey fog. Perhaps the Zragnirr are a kind of deliberate, natural guard.

Ships thrash on the violent waves, making their way through the hazy expanse. The smartest of them make a wide berth. One is trying to approach that castle on the largest of the islands in the Zragnirr seas.

*Crunch.*

A huge purple hand reaching from the sky grasps the large merchant ship. The putrid smell of it blends with the gusting winds. It’s a horrible stench, like the islands themselves have a case of infected breath.",,

Ouch.

A tiny bug bit me. Instinctively, I swat at it. My hand impacts with something small and gooey.

I inspect my palm, peeling off the dead insect. There's a dotted line of punctured holes. The bite mark is punctuated with a tiny red dot.

It doesn't hurt at first, but in mere minutes, there's a sensation of deep burning. I watch the tiny wounds as they emit white pus, the skin glazing over like some strange bacterial infection.

""I think I need help,"" I mutter.

My legs gear up, itching to walk back to the nearby settlement. Except my muscles don't release, they clench and clench. I convulse, landing face first into the dirt, eating it. Bone deep, I ache. I feel stuck, unable to move my limbs. I pulse my muscles, trying to emit motion.

Until my lungs refuse to breathe.

The panic is red hot as asphyxiation envelops me. I gag on nothing and cease.",,

She waits for her best friend in the Grevan Forest at their usual spot. Their enthusiasm for nature always leads them to explore.

She hears a hissing scream and something like flapping wings, but like the bones in them are crunching together.

Fear engulfs her, yet she wants to see the origin of the mysterious sound.

Its voice reverberates again, much more powerful this time, followed by total silence.

Frozen, she hears odd sounds of soft, dull chewing, like something eating thick rubber. Following it leads to a tree: a thin barrier between her and whatever this thing is.

The girl peeks and sees the horror of bones. Her heart races. A human sized bird eats something unidentifiable. The bird has no flesh on its wings and its bones are visible. Except its head, the rest is a mixture of melted skin and muscles.

When the bird lifts its gaze, the girl cries out in fear. Its eye sockets are empty. It’s impossible to see where the bird looks, or know if it can see anything at all.",,

Iskadiel, the crown operator, stands behind the mass of Grevan troops. A weak glow emanates from her. It’s as if all of reality has a fog over it, with clarity only existing around her.

The Grevan rangers march through a hail of bullets, musket-like rifles in hand.

*Bang! Bang!* A deathly silence partners with metallic sounds of reloading.

Iskadiel cannot focus on so many lives. The bullets warp around the rangers, embedding into their subordinate comrades. The Phanamites must wonder why their bullets seem to run from the leaders in their sights.

""The bullets cannot hurt us! Rush! Rush!"" a ranger screams, spurring on the Grevan horde.",,

I look at her and close my eyes, retaining the image.

When I open them wide, it doesn't match. She's changed. The lighting, my eyes… some minute detail is different.

Repeat ad nauseam.

There's nothing consistent. There is no her.

There's something at the center of all the slightly varying perspectives, at the central limit of a normal distribution. In an uncountable infinity of variations, I find myself unable to resolve the continuum.

She's an idea I can get infinitely close to, but never reach.

I wave my hand in front of myself, watching the motion blur.

Close. Open. Close. Open.

It's prettier than it looks.

I turn away, glancing at the mirror. There exists an idea of me, like pixels on a screen understood to be human. If I look hard enough, there is no such understanding: only pixels. It's the way all faces appear symmetric until the illusion breaks.

Do I even exist if there is no one true way to see myself?

The figure in the mirror vanishes.",,

We lost Jack. That was pretty early on. It was too cold for him. He was scrawny, so we made our way deeper into the Garden of Residues slowly, carefully, step-by-step. We heard it was a dangerous place, so we were taking the adventure easy.

I slouch on the hard slate floor of the clearing we decided to rest at. My companions are around me, sleeping. I try not to drift off during my shift of keeping watch. The garden is tripping me out, the colours blending, blurring like a bad Van Gogh knock-off. The weak torchlight barely cuts through the immense black sky. Where are the stars?

Only a couple hours later, I hear something whispering. I think it's calling my name. I shuffle towards a nearby cave, wondering what it is. The air gets dense and I start to feel claustrophobic. The cave is ominous and threatening, like the darkness is moving to envelop me.

As I continue, the rocks change from grey to pale white. I reach out and tap a spot on the cave wall. Strangely, it feels warm. I gulp, feeling unnerved, and turn to leave.

The wall slithers, trapping me inside the cave. Again, I hear that voice. This time it shrieks with insane delight.

Unsure what to do, I wander deeper. What else could I do?

The walls creep in-step with my feet, moving when I do. Behind me, the space seems to open up. Eventually, I reach a dim cavern, risen in the center like a podium.

I walk towards that risen pillar of rock, miserable understanding slowly materializing to the forefront of my awareness.

The voice speaks. ""These are my darlings. It is time for them to feast.""

The walls lunge at me with human-like jaws, pale scales, and razor-sharp teeth.",,

""Alice, I think something's watching us. Did you hear that?""

""Hear what?""

""There's a rustling.""

""Babe, it's probably just the wind.""

Purple eyes blink in the lake surface, reflecting from somewhere above the ground.

Alice looks up. ""There's a cat up in that tree! Look!""

""What's it holding?""

It presses a giant pause button on an oversized television remote. *Zap.*

Alice and her boyfriend freeze in place, eyes fearful and frantically moving. The cryptic cat plops down onto the forest floor, purple eyes mischievous.

*Beep.* ""I'll need two cages for a male and a female. Both human."" The cat speaks into its remote. ""I wonder how much their offspring will be worth on the market.""",,

I enter a mysterious mansion. Around it are empty homes and tents, frozen in time as if the inhabitants had been whisked away. The communal dining hall has wooden pitchers, nearly empty of blueish tea. The liquid left acidic burns around the edges of tiny cups aligned nicely to the seats of a long table.

That same shade of blue floats about the mansion basement. Spherical forms glow with symbols of wealth. They shy away when I reach for them, trying to touch them. Are they solid?

Their swirling trails hang in the air, giving me flashbacks of their memories when I walk through them. Visions eerily similar to the picturesque, abandoned village.

Not long ago, it seems a mysterious man arrived. Their thoughts are fixated on his whereabouts. Oddly, they can't remember what he looked like.",,
